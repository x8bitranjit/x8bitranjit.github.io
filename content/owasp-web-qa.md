# §0 — THE FRAMEWORK ITSELF

### Q1. What is the OWASP Top 10, and what is it *not*?
An **awareness document** ranking the ten most critical web-application security **risk categories**, refreshed ~every 3–4 years (current stable: **2021**). It is **not** a standard, not a checklist, and not a list of individual vulnerabilities — each entry is a broad *category* that many concrete vuln-classes fall under. Treating it as "ten bugs to check" is the #1 beginner mistake; it's ten *families*, and you test every member.

### Q2. How is the 2021 list ranked, and why does that matter?
By a blend of **data** (prevalence across ~500k apps) and a **community survey** (forward-looking risks the data lags on). Eight categories are data-driven; two (A04, A10) came largely from the survey. It matters because **ranking ≠ your report's severity** — OWASP ranks by *how common + how bad on average*; your finding is scored by *demonstrated impact on this target*.

### Q3. Name the 2021 Top 10 in order.
A01 Broken Access Control · A02 Cryptographic Failures · A03 Injection · A04 Insecure Design · A05 Security Misconfiguration · A06 Vulnerable and Outdated Components · A07 Identification and Authentication Failures · A08 Software and Data Integrity Failures · A09 Security Logging and Monitoring Failures · A10 Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

### Q4. What changed from 2017 → 2021? (a very common interview question)
- **Three new categories:** A04 **Insecure Design**, A08 **Software and Data Integrity Failures**, A10 **SSRF**.
- **A01 Broken Access Control** moved from #5 to **#1**.
- **A03 Injection dropped to #3** and **absorbed XSS**.
- **Sensitive Data Exposure → A02 Cryptographic Failures** (renamed to the root cause).
- **XXE folded into A05**; **Insecure Deserialization → part of A08**; **Broken Authentication → A07** (renamed *Identification and Authentication Failures*).

### Q5. Where did XSS and XXE go in 2021?
**XSS** merged into **A03 Injection** (client-side injection). **XXE** merged into **A05 Security Misconfiguration** (a parser-config problem). Both are still real bugs with their own deep kits here (`XSS/`, `XXE/`) — they just lost standalone Top-10 slots.

### Q6. Risk category vs vulnerability class vs CWE vs CVE?
**Risk category** (A03 Injection) = the OWASP bucket. **Vulnerability class** (SQL injection) = a concrete bug kind. **CWE** (CWE-89) = the weakness *type* ID. **CVE** (CVE-2021-44228) = a specific *instance* in a specific product. A CVE is an instance of a CWE; the CWE falls under an OWASP category.

### Q7. How do you use the Top 10 as a *method*, not memorization?
For each category: **what it is → how to test (which concrete classes) → the kit that owns the payloads → the impact ceiling → prevention.** Run by **impact**, not list order (see Q11).

### Q8. Which categories carry the RCE ceiling?
**A03** (cmdi/SSTI/SQLi-file-write→RCE), **A08** (deserialization→RCE), **A06** (known-CVE component like Log4Shell→RCE), **A10** (SSRF→cloud metadata→IAM→cloud takeover/RCE). RCE = full compromise, so bounties and CVSS peak there.

### Q9. Which category is the most common source of real breaches/high bounties?
**A01 Broken Access Control** — #1 by prevalence, trivially impactful, and scanner-resistant (authorization is app-specific logic). Start here on most engagements.

### Q10. Is there a Top 10 for non-web surfaces?
Yes — OWASP maintains **API Security (2023)**, **Mobile (2024)**, **LLM Applications (2025)**, plus Serverless/CI-CD/Docker lists. Each re-centers on its surface's failure modes. This repo has umbrella docs + Q&A for API, Mobile, and LLM.

### Q11. In what order should you actually attack the Top 10?
1) **Recon + inventory** (A05/A06 exposure, endpoints, versions). 2) **A01** access control (two-account diffs). 3) **A03** injection (RCE/dump). 4) **A10** SSRF (cloud). 5) **A07 + A08** (ATO + RCE). 6) **A02/A05** (quick wins). 7) **A04/A09** (logic abuse + detection gaps). Impact-first, not numeric.

### Q12. Interview cross-cutting — authN vs authZ, encoding vs encryption vs hashing, CVSS vs OWASP-rank, ASVS, defense-in-depth?
- **AuthN** = proving *who you are* (A07); **authZ** = *what you may do* (A01). AuthN is the gate; authZ is the rules inside.
- **Encoding** (Base64/URL) reversible/no-key/representation (not security); **encryption** reversible-with-key/confidentiality; **hashing** one-way/integrity (passwords need a *slow salted* KDF).
- **Severity = CVSS** for your specific finding; **OWASP rank is not a severity** (it's average prevalence+impact). Cite category + CWE + CVSS.
- **ASVS** = the leveled, testable *requirements* you verify against; the Top 10 is *awareness*. "Top 10 to prioritize, ASVS+WSTG to verify."
- **Defense in depth** = independent layers so one failure isn't fatal (e.g., XSS: validation + output-encoding + CSP + HttpOnly).

# §A01 — BROKEN ACCESS CONTROL

**Core**

### Q13. What is Broken Access Control and what are its sub-types?
Users acting outside intended permissions. Sub-types: **IDOR/BOLA** (object-level), **missing function-level authz / BFLA**, **vertical** (user→admin) and **horizontal** (user→other user) escalation, **forced browsing**, **metadata/JWT/cookie** manipulation for authz, **CORS-enabled** cross-origin read, **path-based** bypass. → kits: `IDOR/`, `JWT/`, `CORS/`, `PathTraversal/`, `LFI/`.

### Q14. IDOR vs BOLA — same thing?
Effectively yes. **IDOR** is the classic web term; **BOLA** is the API term (API1). Both = "the app exposes an object reference and doesn't check you're allowed *that* object." Interviewers like that you know they're the same defect.

### Q15. Why is A01 #1 in 2021?
Most prevalent (found in a huge share of apps), high impact (cross-user/admin data → mass PII/ATO), and hard for scanners because authorization is bespoke business logic, not a signature. It moved up from #5.

**How to test**

### Q16. What's the single most productive A01 technique?
The **two-account differential**: do an action as user A, capture the exact request, replay it as user B (or against A's IDs with B's session) — success = authz not enforced server-side. Automate with Burp **Autorize/Autorepeater**.

### Q17. How do you test forced browsing and function-level authz?
Enumerate **unlinked/privileged paths** directly (`/admin`, `/api/internal/*`, `/user/123/promote`) with a low-priv or no token; guess by pattern from known routes; mine JS bundles for routes. If GET `/users/{id}` exists, try POST/PUT/DELETE and `/users/{id}/promote`. "Button not shown" is a UI control, not a security control.

### Q18. How do JWT/cookie/parameter manipulation get tested?
Tamper client-held authz signals the server may trust: JWT `role:user→admin` (if `alg:none`/weak-secret/unverified — → `JWT/`), cookie `isAdmin=0→1`, hidden field `account_type`, mass-assign `role` in a body. Confirm the server *acts* on the tampered value.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q19. How do you escalate a "read one other user's record" IDOR?
Push three axes: **breadth** (enumerate *all* IDs → mass PII), **verbs** (PUT/PATCH/DELETE also unchecked → tamper/destroy), **sensitivity** (PII/payment/admin/cross-tenant). "One profile" = Medium; "enumerate + modify every account" = Critical. Always maximize breadth × write × sensitivity.

### Q20. How does A01 fit a kill chain?
IDOR leaks an admin's data → weak reset (**A07**) → admin ATO → stored XSS in admin panel (**A03**) → mass session theft. Or mass-assignment privilege escalation → admin functions → config change → RCE. A01 is the classic *foothold/escalation* link.

**Interview**

### Q21. "What's the difference between authentication and authorization?"
**AuthN** proves identity (A07); **authZ** decides permissions once authenticated (A01). Broken authZ (A01) is #1; broken authN (A07) is #7. Interviewers ask this constantly.

### Q22. "You can change a URL `id` and see another user's invoice. Rate and escalate it."
Baseline **High** (cross-user PII disclosure via IDOR/BOLA, CWE-639). Escalate: can I **enumerate** all invoices (mass breach → Critical)? Can I **modify/delete** (write → higher)? Whose data (payment/PII)? Prove with two own accounts ("as A I read/edited B's invoice"), then report impact-first.

**Prevention**

### Q23. How is A01 prevented?
**Deny by default**; enforce authorization **server-side on every request**, per-object *and* per-function; never trust client-supplied identity/role; ownership checks (not just unguessable IDs — that's obscurity); **centralize** the authz mechanism; log access-control failures (A09); test authz systematically (two-account diffs in CI).

### Q24. Why isn't "use UUIDs / unguessable IDs" a sufficient fix?
That's **security by obscurity** — a UUID leaked elsewhere (referrer, logs, another endpoint, an email) is still accepted because the server never checks *ownership*. Unguessable IDs are defense-in-depth; the real fix is the per-object authorization check.

### Q25. Real-world A01 examples?
Facebook/Instagram-class IDOR mass account access; mass-assignment privilege escalation (`isAdmin` in body); admin panels via forced browsing; JWT `role` tampering. Among the highest-paid bug classes.

### Q26. CWEs for A01?
CWE-284 (Improper Access Control), CWE-285 (Improper Authorization), **CWE-639** (IDOR / authz via user-controlled key), CWE-862 (Missing Authorization), CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization), CWE-732, CWE-22. Cite CWE-639 for IDOR.

# §A02 — CRYPTOGRAPHIC FAILURES

**Core**

### Q27. What is A02 and why renamed from "Sensitive Data Exposure"?
Failures in (or absence of) cryptography exposing sensitive data. Renamed to point at the **root cause** (bad/missing crypto) rather than the *symptom* (exposed data). Covers cleartext transport/storage, weak/deprecated algorithms, poor key management, weak password hashing, predictable tokens, improper cert validation.

### Q28. Encoding vs encryption vs hashing? (classic junior filter)
**Encoding** (Base64/URL) — reversible, no key, representation only, *not security*. **Encryption** — reversible with a key, for confidentiality. **Hashing** — one-way, for integrity; passwords need a **slow, salted KDF**. Calling Base64 "encryption" is an instant red flag.

**How to test**

### Q29. First things you check for A02?
Transport (cleartext HTTP for sensitive data? missing HSTS? mixed content? cert gaps?), token/JWT crypto (`alg:none`, weak HS256 secret, RS256→HS256, no expiry — → `JWT/`), password-storage indicators (MD5/SHA1/unsalted in a disclosed dump), predictable reset/session/CSRF tokens (→ `AccountTakeover/`), secrets leaked in responses/JS/config (→ `JSFiles/`, `Recon/`).

### Q30. How do you test password-hashing strength when you get a dump?
Identify the algorithm (length/format/`$2b$` etc.). Fast unsalted (raw MD5/SHA1/SHA256) → crackable at scale with `hashcat` → **weak (A02)**. Adaptive salted KDF (Argon2id/bcrypt/scrypt/PBKDF2) → acceptable. Demonstrate by cracking *your own* seeded test account, not real users.

### Q31. Where does weak randomness bite?
Non-crypto PRNG (`java.util.Random`, `Math.random()`) or predictable seeds for session IDs, reset/CSRF tokens, OTPs, API keys, IVs/nonces → forgeable/guessable → ATO. Fix: `SecureRandom`/`crypto.randomBytes`/`os.urandom`.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q32. How does an A02 finding become ATO/RCE?
Weak JWT secret → forge an admin token → **ATO**. Predictable reset token → seize accounts. Leaked machineKey (A02 key-management) → ViewState deserialization → **RCE** (bridges A08). Sniffed session over HTTP → hijack. The crypto weakness is usually a *step*, not the finish — chain it.

**Interview**

### Q33. "How would you store passwords correctly?"
A **slow, salted, password-specific KDF** — **Argon2id** (preferred), else bcrypt/scrypt/PBKDF2 — with a per-user salt (and ideally a server-side pepper). Never a fast general hash. Say "not MD5/SHA-*, not encryption" explicitly.

### Q34. "What is HSTS and what attack does it stop?"
`Strict-Transport-Security` tells browsers to only use HTTPS for the domain, preventing **SSL-strip / downgrade** MITM (where an attacker forces HTTP to sniff credentials). Pair with `includeSubDomains` + preload.

### Q35. "What's the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?"
**Symmetric** — one shared key, fast, for bulk data (AES). **Asymmetric** — public/private key pair, slow, for key exchange/signatures (RSA/ECC). TLS uses asymmetric to exchange a symmetric session key, then symmetric for the data.

**Prevention**

### Q36. Prevention for A02?
TLS everywhere + HSTS; strong modern algorithms (AES-GCM, SHA-256+); adaptive KDFs for passwords; cryptographic RNG for all tokens; sound key management (rotation, hardware-backed, no hardcoding); classify + minimize sensitive data; don't return secrets in responses; validate certs.

### Q37. CWEs for A02?
CWE-259/261 (hardcoded/weak-protected password), CWE-319 (cleartext transmission), CWE-321 (hardcoded key), CWE-326/327 (weak/broken crypto), CWE-328 (weak hash), CWE-331 (insufficient entropy), CWE-916 (weak password hash).

# §A03 — INJECTION

**Core**

### Q38. What is injection, and what unifies the class?
Untrusted input is interpreted as **code/command/query** by a downstream interpreter because data and control share one string. The unifying fix is **separation of code and data** (parameterization / safe APIs / context-aware encoding) so input can never change *structure*.

### Q39. Which concrete classes live under A03 and which kits own them?
SQLi (`SQLi/`), NoSQLi (`NoSQLi/`), OS command injection (`CommandInjection/`), SSTI (`SSTI/`), XPath/XQuery (`XPath/`), LDAP (`LDAP/`), expression-language, CRLF/header injection (`OpenRedirect/` §CRLF + `HostHeader/`), server-side JS / prototype pollution (`PrototypePollution/`), XSS (`XSS/`), XXE (`XXE/`, though bucketed in A05). Largest kit cluster in the repo.

### Q40. Why did XSS get folded into Injection?
Because XSS **is** injection — input interpreted as **code by the browser** (HTML/JS). Same root cause (data-as-control), same fix family (context-aware output encoding + sanitization). Grouping reflects the mechanism, not the location.

**How to test**

### Q41. How do you detect injection with low false positives?
**Prove interpretation, not reflection.** A reflected `'`/`;` is not a bug. Confirm the interpreter *acted*: boolean-differential pages, a **repeatable** time delay vs a control baseline (blind), an **OOB** callback carrying your marker (blind), or real command/query output. Control-baseline every probe.

### Q42. How do you quickly distinguish SSTI vs XSS vs code injection?
Math probe `{{7*7}}` / `${7*7}` / `<%= 7*7 %>`: renders **49** server-side → **SSTI** (→ often RCE); reflected but executes in browser → **XSS**; language `eval` of input → **code injection**. Then fingerprint the template engine to pick the RCE payload. → `SSTI/`.

### Q43. What is second-order (stored) injection?
Payload **stored** on one request, executed on a **later** one in a different context (username saved now, concatenated into an admin query later). Detection requires tracking where stored values are *reused*, defeating naive per-request scanners.

### Q44. What's CRLF / header injection?
Injecting `\r\n` into a header context (value reflected into `Location`/`Set-Cookie`) → **response splitting**, cookie injection, cache poisoning, open-redirect chaining. Under A03; covered by `OpenRedirect/` (§CRLF) + `HostHeader/`.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q45. What's the impact ceiling per major injection class?
SQLi → dump/auth-bypass/file-RW→webshell→**RCE**/lateral; command injection & SSTI → direct **RCE**; NoSQLi → auth bypass + blind exfil (→ RCE on some engines); XSS → session theft/**ATO**/worm; LDAP/XPath → auth bypass + directory/XML dump. Top source of Criticals.

### Q46. How does SQLi become RCE?
MSSQL `xp_cmdshell`; PostgreSQL `COPY ... FROM PROGRAM` / untrusted PL; MySQL `INTO OUTFILE` webshell in webroot / UDF; Oracle Java procs. Also file-read of source/secrets, and privesc via linked servers for lateral movement. → `SQLi/`.

### Q47. How does command injection reach cloud takeover?
RCE → read cloud metadata (`169.254.169.254`) → **IAM credentials** → assume role → cloud account takeover. Or pivot internally, read secrets, drop persistence. The category's job in a chain is code execution or credentials.

**Interview**

### Q48. "How do you prevent SQL injection?"
**Parameterized queries / prepared statements** (separate code from data so input can't change query structure). Supplement with least-privilege DB accounts, allow-list validation, a correctly-used ORM. Explicitly: "not escaping/blacklisting" — that's the tell you know the real fix.

### Q49. "Stored vs reflected vs DOM XSS?"
**Reflected** — request payload echoed in the immediate response (needs a click). **Stored** — saved server-side, served to *every* viewer (worse). **DOM** — injection happens client-side in JS (source like `location.hash` → sink like `innerHTML`), often invisible to the server. → `XSS/`.

### Q50. "What is CSRF and how is it different from XSS?"
**CSRF** — attacker's site makes the victim's browser send a *state-changing* request to a site where the victim is authed, abusing ambient cookies (attacker can't read the response). **XSS** — attacker runs *script in the victim's context* (reads data, does anything). XSS is strictly stronger and defeats most CSRF defenses. Fix CSRF: SameSite + anti-CSRF tokens. → `CSRF/`.

### Q51. "What's the difference between SQLi and NoSQLi?"
SQLi targets an SQL parser (string/query structure via quotes/UNION/comments). NoSQLi targets document/operator stores — **operator injection** (`{"$ne":null}` auth bypass, `$gt`/`$regex`) and **server-side JS** (`$where`) for blind exfil. Different syntax, similar ceilings (auth bypass, exfil, sometimes RCE). → `NoSQLi/`.

**Prevention**

### Q52. Prevention per injection class?
Parameterized queries (SQL); operator allow-listing / safe query builders (NoSQL); **avoid the shell**, use exec-array APIs (command); sandbox/disable dangerous template features + never template user input (SSTI); context-aware output encoding + CSP + sanitizer (XSS); escape for the exact interpreter; least-privilege service accounts to cap blast radius.

### Q53. What is CSP and how does it mitigate XSS?
Content-Security-Policy restricts which script sources execute (nonce/hash/allow-list, no inline). Even if an injection lands, a strict CSP blocks the script from running — defense-in-depth behind output encoding. It mitigates, doesn't cure; still fix the injection.

### Q54. CWEs for A03?
CWE-79 (XSS), CWE-89 (SQLi), CWE-78 (OS command), CWE-90 (LDAP), CWE-91/643 (XML/XPath), CWE-94 (code), CWE-1336/917 (template/expression-language), CWE-74 (generic injection).

### Q55. Real-world A03 examples?
Endless SQLi breaches; SSTI-to-RCE (Jinja2/Twig); command injection in image/PDF processors (ImageTragick, Ghostscript); stored XSS session theft; NoSQLi auth bypass (`{"$ne":null}`).

### Q56. What's the difference between a WAF blocking a payload and the bug being fixed?
A **WAF** is a bypassable edge filter matching known patterns — it doesn't fix the code. The bug is fixed only when the sink is made safe (parameterization/encoding). Always report the underlying bug; note the WAF as mitigation, not remediation.

---

# §A04 — INSECURE DESIGN

**Core**

### Q57. What is Insecure Design in one line?
A **missing or ineffective security control at the design level** — the flaw is in *what was designed*, not a coding mistake, so it can't be patched with input handling; it needs a design change (threat modeling, secure patterns, abuse-case testing). New in 2021.

### Q58. The canonical example distinguishing A04 from an implementation bug?
A password-reset flow with **no rate limiting by design** → unlimited OTP/token guessing → ATO. Validation doesn't help; the *design* omitted anti-automation. Contrast: an SQLi in that endpoint is an *implementation* bug (A03). Same feature, different category.

**How to test**

### Q59. What concrete testing lives under A04?
**Business-logic abuse** (negative/overflow quantities, price/parameter manipulation, workflow-step skipping, coupon stacking, one-time-action replay, state-machine bypass); **race conditions** (limit-overrun via parallel requests — → `RaceCondition/`); **missing-by-design rate limiting** (OTP/reset brute, enumeration — → `AccountTakeover/`); trust-boundary failures. Scanners miss these — requests are "valid."

### Q60. How do you threat-model to find A04 as an attacker?
Enumerate the app's **invariants** ("only buy what you can pay for," "one reward per account," "steps in order," "price set server-side") and violate each — replay, reorder, parallelize, negate, overflow, skip. A04 findings are broken invariants.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q61. What is a race condition and how does it realize an A04 flaw?
Concurrent requests hitting a **check-then-act** window assumed serial: redeem-once, withdraw-within-balance, one-vote, use-OTP-once. Parallel requests in the window → limit enforced N times but effect applied N times (double-spend/over-redeem). A design failure of atomicity. → `RaceCondition/`.

### Q62. Why is A04 lucrative and scanner-proof?
Every request is *individually valid* (no malformed input) — the bug is in the *sequence, quantity, timing, or trust assumptions*. Automated tools can't infer business intent, so these survive to production and pay well when a human models the flow.

**Interview**

### Q63. "Give an example of a business-logic vulnerability."
Skipping the payment step by calling the order-confirmation endpoint directly; setting a negative quantity to get a credit; stacking one-per-user coupons via parallel requests (race); manipulating a client-set price. All "valid" requests, real financial impact — that's A04.

**Prevention**

### Q64. Prevention + CWEs for A04?
Threat-model early; secure design patterns + a vetted control library; enforce business rules server-side + re-validate each step; design in rate limiting / anti-automation / **atomicity** (transactions, locks); write and test **abuse cases**; segment trust boundaries. CWEs: CWE-209, CWE-256, CWE-501, CWE-522, **CWE-362** (race), CWE-841 (workflow).

# §A05 — SECURITY MISCONFIGURATION

**Core**

### Q65. What's the scope of A05?
Insecure/default configuration anywhere in the stack — app, server, framework, cloud, container — **plus XXE** (folded in 2021). Default creds, verbose errors/debug, unnecessary features/ports/methods, missing security headers, permissive CORS, directory listing, exposed admin/management interfaces, misconfigured cloud storage.

### Q66. Why is XXE under Security Misconfiguration?
XXE is fundamentally a **parser configuration** problem — the XML parser is left with external-entity/DTD processing *enabled* (an insecure default). The fix is a config change (disable DOCTYPE/external entities), so it's grouped with misconfiguration. → `XXE/`.

**How to test**

### Q67. Fastest A05 wins on most targets?
**Exposure recon**: exposed `.git`/`.env`/backup files (→ source + secrets), open cloud buckets, directory listing, default creds on admin/management interfaces, debug mode leaking stack traces/secrets, missing security headers. Quick, high-signal, common. → `Recon/`, `JSFiles/`.

### Q68. Which concrete classes/kits route from A05?
`XXE/` (parser), `HostHeader/` (host-based reset/cache/routing), `CORS/` (permissive origin), `WebCache/` (cache poisoning/deception), `RequestSmuggling/` (front/back desync), `SubdomainTakeover/` (dangling DNS), `FileUpload/` (unrestricted upload→webshell), `Recon/`+`JSFiles/`.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q69. How does XXE escalate beyond file read?
`file://` → local file read (`/etc/passwd`, source via `php://filter`); `http://` to internal/metadata → **SSRF → cloud IAM creds**; blind OOB via external DTD + parameter entities; parser-specific → **RCE** (`expect://`, jar). Frequently a Critical, not a Medium. → `XXE/`.

### Q70. What's the impact range of A05?
Info leak (verbose errors, directory listing) → data breach (open bucket, exposed `.git`/`.env`, exposed admin) → **RCE** (XXE→file/SSRF/RCE; default creds on a console; debug endpoints). Always chase the config finding to its worst reachable impact.

**Interview**

### Q71. "You find an exposed `.git` directory. What now?"
Dump it (`git-dumper`) → recover full **source** and history → hunt hardcoded **secrets/keys/DB creds/machineKey** → map the app and find more bugs from source → chain (e.g., machineKey → ViewState RCE). An exposed `.git` is often the start of a Critical, not just an info leak.

**Prevention**

### Q72. Prevention for A05?
Harden by default (no defaults, no debug in prod, minimal features/ports/methods); **disable XXE** (no DOCTYPE/external entities); security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, frame options); strict CORS + Host allow-list; lock down cloud storage; remove exposed VCS/config/backups; automated config review + drift detection.

### Q73. CWEs for A05?
CWE-16 (configuration), CWE-2 (environmental), **CWE-611** (XXE), CWE-548 (info exposure via directory listing), CWE-756, CWE-1032.

# §A06 — VULNERABLE & OUTDATED COMPONENTS

**Core**

### Q74. What is A06 and why is it uniquely "cheap" for attackers?
Using components (libraries, frameworks, runtimes, OS packages, front-end deps) with **known vulnerabilities** or unmaintained/outdated/un-inventoried — you inherit their CVEs. Cheap because the exploit already exists ("n-day"): fingerprint the version, grab the PoC, fire. No novel research.

**How to test**

### Q75. How do you test for A06?
**Fingerprint** components + versions (server headers, framework tells, JS lib versions via retire.js, package manifests, favicon hashes → `Recon/`, `JSFiles/`); **map to known CVEs**; **verify exploitability in-context**. RCE classes: Log4Shell (`JNDI/`), deserialization gadgets (`Deserialization/`), vulnerable front-end libs → XSS/prototype pollution.

### Q76. Why is "version-in-a-list ≠ a finding"?
A version match doesn't prove the vulnerable code path is used/reachable or that a backport patch isn't applied. Reporting raw scanner output causes false positives and burns triager trust. **Prove reachability/exploitability** or clearly label "potential."

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q77. What's the relationship between A06 and A08?
They overlap on **supply chain**: A06 = "you use a component with a *known* vuln"; A08 = "the component/update/pipeline lacks *integrity* protection." A known-CVE deserialization gadget is both. Follow the chain, not the label.

**Interview**

### Q78. "You find an outdated jQuery. Is that a finding?"
Not by itself. Confirm the specific CVE's vulnerable code path is **reachable** with attacker-controlled input and demonstrate real impact (DOM XSS / prototype pollution). Otherwise it's "informational/potential," clearly labeled. (Tests whether you inflate A06.)

**Prevention**

### Q79. Prevention for A06?
Inventory components (**SBOM**); patch/update continuously; monitor advisories for your stack; remove unused deps; pin + verify integrity; run **SCA** in CI.

### Q80. Real-world A06 examples + CWEs?
Log4Shell (Log4j RCE); Struts/Spring4Shell; deserialization RCE via ysoserial/PHPGGC gadgets; vulnerable jQuery/AngularJS → XSS; typosquatted npm/PyPI (→ `DependencyConfusion/`). CWEs: CWE-1104, CWE-937/1035.

# §A07 — IDENTIFICATION & AUTHENTICATION FAILURES

**Core**

### Q81. What is A07?
Weaknesses in confirming identity, authenticating, and managing sessions (formerly "Broken Authentication"). Credential stuffing/brute exposure, weak/default passwords, weak MFA, session flaws (fixation, no invalidation, exposure), weak reset flows, identity-federation (OAuth/SSO/SAML) flaws.

### Q82. What's the impact ceiling and why?
**Account takeover** — the whole category is impersonating a user. Break auth and everything behind it is accessible as that user/admin. Weak reset → ATO; no rate limit → brute/OTP bypass; fixation/no-invalidation → hijack; OAuth misconfig → token theft; stuffing → *mass* ATO.

**How to test**

### Q83. Which kits own A07 work?
`AccountTakeover/` (reset/2FA/OTP/session/registration), `JWT/` (token crypto), `OAuth/` (OAuth2/OIDC/SAML), `CSRF/` (login-CSRF). Most A07 testing is "abuse the recovery/session/federation flow."

### Q84. Walk through testing a password-reset flow.
Check **host/link poisoning** (Host header controls the reset link → capture token — → `HostHeader/`); **token entropy** (sequential/timestamp/short); **token leakage** (`Referer`/logs/response); **email HPP/CRLF** (second recipient); **no rate limit** (brute token/OTP); **reuse/expiry** (works twice? never expires?); **user enumeration**. → `AccountTakeover/`.

### Q85. What headline OAuth/SSO flaws do you test?
`redirect_uri` bypass (→ code/token theft), missing `state` (→ login CSRF / account-linking ATO), code replay, PKCE downgrade/omission, `id_token` forgery (`alg:none`/unverified sig/`aud` swap), SAML XSW/sig-strip/comment-canonicalization. → `OAuth/` (+ `JWT/`).

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q86. What is "pre-account-takeover" and why is it a favorite?
Attacker **pre-registers** the victim's email (unverified); victim later signs up via SSO which **merges/links** to the attacker-seeded account → attacker keeps access → ATO. Silent, high-impact, commonly missed. → `OAuth/` + `AccountTakeover/`.

### Q87. How does a JWT flaw become full ATO?
`alg:none` (server accepts unsigned) → forge any `sub`/`role`; weak HS256 secret → crack + sign an admin token; RS256→HS256 confusion → sign with the public key as HMAC secret; `kid`/`jku` injection → point verification at your key. Any → impersonate arbitrary users/admin. → `JWT/`.

**Interview**

### Q88. "How do you implement secure session management?"
Rotate the session ID on login (defeat fixation); invalidate server-side on logout + expiry; short-lived + idle timeout; `HttpOnly` + `Secure` + `SameSite` cookies; never put session IDs in URLs; bind to context where feasible. AuthN success must issue a *new* session.

### Q89. "What is MFA and does it stop everything?"
Multi-factor requires ≥2 of know/have/are. It blocks credential-stuffing/phishing of passwords alone — but not **weak MFA** (no rate limit on OTP → brute; OTP over SMS → SIM-swap; response-flip; backup-code abuse; MFA-fatigue push-bombing). So MFA presence ≠ MFA done right. → `AccountTakeover/`.

**Prevention**

### Q90. Prevention for A07?
MFA; no default/weak passwords + breached-password checks; **rate limiting + lockout** on all auth/OTP/reset endpoints; secure sessions (Q88); host-independent reset links + strong tokens; exact-match OAuth `redirect_uri` + `state` + PKCE; verify email before SSO linking.

### Q91. CWEs for A07?
CWE-287 (improper authentication), CWE-384 (session fixation), CWE-307 (improper restriction of auth attempts), CWE-620 (unverified password change), CWE-640 (weak reset), CWE-798 (hardcoded creds), CWE-613 (insufficient session expiration).

# §A08 — SOFTWARE & DATA INTEGRITY FAILURES

**Core**

### Q92. What is A08 and why introduced in 2021?
Code/infrastructure failing to protect against **integrity violations** — trusting unverified sources/plugins/data, auto-updates without integrity checks, **insecure deserialization** (folded in), **CI/CD** compromise. Introduced to capture the rise of **software supply-chain** + deserialization risk under one integrity theme.

### Q93. Why is insecure deserialization the headline?
Deserializing attacker-controlled data can instantiate arbitrary objects and trigger **gadget chains → RCE**. It's an integrity failure — the app trusts a serialized blob it can't verify. Per-language: Java `ObjectInputStream` (ysoserial), PHP `unserialize`/phar (PHPGGC), .NET `BinaryFormatter`/ViewState (ysoserial.net), Python `pickle`, Ruby `Marshal`, Node `node-serialize`. → `Deserialization/`.

**How to test**

### Q94. How do you *safely* confirm deserialization without a shell?
**OOB-first**: a benign gadget causing only a **DNS/HTTP callback** (Java **URLDNS**) or a `sleep` — proves the blob is deserialized *without* running attacker code on the target. Then stop and report (SAFE-PoC discipline).

### Q95. What are ViewState and machineKey?
ASP.NET **ViewState** is a serialized blob round-tripped via the client. If **not MAC-protected** or the **machineKey** is leaked/default, an attacker forges a malicious ViewState → deserialization → **RCE** (ysoserial.net). A leaked machineKey (via `.git`/config/LFI) → RCE — bridges A02/A05/A08. → `Deserialization/`.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q96. How does A08 cover CI/CD and updates?
Auto-updates that fetch + run code **without signature verification**, unsigned artifacts, injectable pipeline steps, compromised deps (dependency confusion/typosquatting — → `DependencyConfusion/`). **SolarWinds** is the archetype: trusted pipeline → signed-but-poisoned artifact → mass compromise.

**Interview**

### Q97. "Why is deserializing untrusted data dangerous?"
Because deserialization can *reconstruct arbitrary object graphs* and invoke methods during/after construction; with the right **gadget chain** already on the classpath, that leads to code execution — without the app ever "intending" to run code. The fix is: don't deserialize untrusted data, or use data-only formats + type allow-lists + integrity checks.

**Prevention**

### Q98. Prevention for A08?
Avoid deserializing untrusted data (or safe formats + type allow-lists + integrity/signature checks); **sign + verify** updates/plugins/artifacts; verify dependency integrity/provenance + pin; secure the CI/CD pipeline (least privilege, signed builds, no injectable steps); never trust unsigned data for security decisions.

### Q99. Real-world A08 examples + CWEs?
ysoserial Java RCE; .NET ViewState RCE via leaked machineKey; PHP phar/POP-chain RCE; SolarWinds CI/CD compromise; dependency-confusion RCE in CI. CWEs: **CWE-502** (deserialization), CWE-345 (insufficient integrity), CWE-494 (download without integrity check), CWE-829, CWE-565.

# §A09 — SECURITY LOGGING & MONITORING FAILURES

**Core**

### Q100. What is A09 and why is it in the Top 10 despite being "defensive"?
Insufficient logging, monitoring, alerting, and incident response — so attacks aren't **detected, escalated, or investigated**. It's listed because inadequate detection **amplifies every other bug** (attackers operate unnoticed, breaches persist, no forensics). It's about time-to-detect, a real risk even without a single "pop this" exploit.

**How to test**

### Q101. How do you assess A09 during a test?
Do noisy things (failed logins, authz denials, injection probes, high-value actions) and ask **"was it detected/alerted?"** Check whether auth failures, access-control denials, input-validation failures, and high-value transactions are logged with context. Red-team: operate below alerting thresholds (anti-forensics) to gauge maturity.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q102. What's the offensive angle on A09?
**Log injection** (CRLF/newline into a logged field → forge/split log entries; or a value that triggers execution when logged → **Log4Shell/JNDI** — → `JNDI/`) and **sensitive data in logs** (PII/tokens/passwords written to logs, later exposed via another bug). So A09 can be both a detection gap *and* a concrete finding.

**Interview**

### Q103. How is Log4Shell related to A09?
The ultimate irony: the **logging** path became RCE. A user-controlled value (User-Agent, username) logged by vulnerable Log4j triggered a **JNDI lookup → remote class load → RCE**. Logging untrusted input *unsafely* is both an A09 concern and an A06/A08 RCE. → `JNDI/`.

**Prevention**

### Q104. Prevention + CWEs for A09?
Log security-relevant events (auth, authz, input failures, high-value actions) with context + integrity; centralize + monitor + **alert**; protect logs (encode logged input; no sensitive data in logs); define + test incident response; retain appropriately. CWEs: CWE-778 (insufficient logging), **CWE-117** (log injection), CWE-223, CWE-532 (sensitive info in logs).

# §A10 — SERVER-SIDE REQUEST FORGERY (SSRF)

**Core**

### Q105. What is SSRF and why its own 2021 slot?
The server is induced to make **requests to attacker-chosen destinations** (fetches a URL/host/resource server-side). It earned a slot (community survey) because modern cloud/microservice apps constantly fetch URLs, and the **cloud-metadata** angle made it a reliable Critical.

### Q106. Why is SSRF the "cloud-era Critical"?
SSRF → `http://169.254.169.254/` (metadata) → **IAM credentials** → assume role → **cloud account takeover / RCE**; or → internal services (admin/Redis/DB/internal APIs) → RCE/lateral; internal port scan; blind SSRF → OOB → chain. **Capital One (2019)** is canonical. → `SSRF/`.

**How to test**

### Q107. Where do SSRF sinks live?
URL params, webhooks, "import from URL," link/URL previews, image/PDF fetchers, PDF-from-HTML, SSO/OIDC **metadata/JWKS** URLs, XML external entities (**XXE→SSRF**). Anywhere the *server* fetches something you influence.

### Q108. How do you bypass SSRF allow-lists/filters?
DNS **rebinding**; **redirect-to-internal** (open redirect on an allow-listed host — → `OpenRedirect/`); IP encodings (decimal/hex/octal/mixed); IPv6 (`[::1]`, `[::ffff:169.254.169.254]`); userinfo (`http://allowed@169.254.169.254/`); alternate schemes (`gopher://`/`dict://`/`file://`); parser differentials between validator and fetcher. → `SSRF/`.

**Red-team / escalation**

### Q109. What's blind SSRF and how do you exploit it?
The server makes the request but you don't see the response. Confirm with an **OOB** listener (Collaborator/interactsh — DNS/HTTP callback). Exploit via `gopher://` to smuggle payloads to internal services (Redis `SET`/`SAVE` → webshell; unauth internal APIs) and infer state from timing/error differences.

**Interview**

### Q110. "Explain SSRF to a junior dev."
"Your server fetches a URL I give it — like a link preview. I give it `http://169.254.169.254/`, a special internal address that hands out your cloud server's credentials. Your server fetches it *for me*, and I get your cloud keys. SSRF = the server making requests on the attacker's behalf to places the attacker can't reach directly."

### Q111. "When is a server-side fetch NOT SSRF?" (common mislabel)
If the **client/browser** makes the request, it's not SSRF — an **open redirect** (server tells the browser to go somewhere) is not SSRF; SSRF requires the **server** to fetch. A URL reflected but never fetched is not SSRF. → `OpenRedirect/` is the sibling, not the same thing.

**Prevention**

### Q112. Prevention for A10?
Avoid fetching client-supplied URLs where possible; else **allow-list** schemes/hosts/ports and **re-validate after every redirect**; block internal ranges + metadata IPs at the network layer (egress filtering, **IMDSv2**); resolve-and-pin DNS (defeat rebinding); disable unused schemes; isolate the fetcher; never return the raw fetch response.

### Q113. What is IMDSv2 and how does it help?
AWS Instance Metadata Service v2 requires a **session token obtained via a PUT** (with a hop-limit) before reading metadata — a simple SSRF `GET` to `169.254.169.254` no longer returns credentials. It's a key SSRF mitigation for AWS; enforce it (and it's a good remediation to recommend in reports).

### Q114. CWE for A10?
**CWE-918** (Server-Side Request Forgery).

# §XC — CROSS-CATEGORY CHAINING & REPORTING

### Q115. How do OWASP categories combine into a full kill chain?
**Recon (A05/A06 exposure)** → exposed `.git` → source + leaked machineKey → **A08** ViewState deserialization → **RCE** → read cloud-metadata (**A10**) → IAM creds → cloud takeover. Or **A01** IDOR → admin data → **A07** weak reset → admin ATO → **A03** stored XSS in admin panel → mass session theft. Chains cross categories; follow impact, not labels.

### Q116. Which categories are "chain enablers" vs "finishers"?
**Enablers** (foothold/primitive): A05/A06 (exposure, known-CVE entry), A01 (reach objects/functions), A02 (leaked tokens/keys), A09 (operate unseen). **Finishers** (the Critical payoff): A03 (RCE/dump), A08 (RCE), A10 (cloud takeover), A07 (ATO). Good reports show the enabler→finisher path.

### Q117. How do you keep false positives low across the Top 10?
**Control-baseline everything**; prove *interpretation/impact* not *reflection*; use two accounts for authz claims; confirm blind bugs with repeatable timing or OOB; verify component CVEs are reachable. A finding reproducible with a benign marker and a clear "as X I did Y to Z" is triager-proof.

### Q118. What's the SAFE-PoC discipline per high-impact category?
RCE (A03/A08): benign marker (`id`/OOB/URLDNS), never destructive. A01/A07: two OWN accounts, "as A I accessed/modified B," restore state. A10: hit your OWN OOB listener / read a benign metadata field, don't harvest real creds. A02: crack your own test token. Own accounts, benign markers, minimal proof, clean up.

### Q119. How do you map a finding back to the Top 10 for a report?
Report the **concrete vuln + demonstrated impact first**, then tag category + CWE + CVSS: "IDOR on `GET /api/orders/{id}` → read any user's orders (**A01**, CWE-639, CVSS 7.5)." Triagers and program scopes speak both; impact-first + framework tag is the professional format.

### Q120. The one meta-lesson across all ten?
**Never trust the client, and separate code from data.** Almost every category is a failure of one: trusting client-supplied identity/role (A01/A07), input becoming code (A03/A08/A10), or trusting unverified components/data/config (A05/A06/A08). Design for zero-trust of input and least privilege of everything, and most of the Top 10 collapses.
